## Key Model Parameters (Default Values)
- Project: 178 lots, 32,133 sqm GFA, 1,650 sqm site, 74-month duration (Apr 2023 - May 2029)
- Land: $124M purchase + $56M PRSV uplift, QLD stamp duty
- Construction: ~$585M (41-month build), 2.49% contingency
- GRV: ~$1.26B total (residential towers ~$989M, retail ~$80M, commercial ~$12M, hotel ~$172M)
- Senior Facility: Margin 2.15% + BBSY 1.96%, establishment 0.5%, line fee 2.15%
- Land Loan: 11.265% rate, quarterly interest, $120M limit
- Equity: 10% of costs (~$130M), developer only (100% contribution, 100% profit share)
- GST Rate: 10%
- PM Fee: 2% of costs

## Debt Solving (Circular Reference Resolution)
The model has a circular dependency: finance costs depend on facility size, facility size depends on total costs, total costs include finance costs. Resolution:
1. Calculate costs excluding interest
2. Determine initial facility from LTC/LVR constraints
3. Calculate interest on facility (daily rate x days outstanding per period)
4. Add interest to costs, recalculate facility
5. Iterate until convergence within tolerance ($10)
6. The Excel uses VBA macro (copy/paste range comparison on Admin row 212-213)

## Tech Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Zustand for state management
- Recharts for visualizations
- TailwindCSS for styling
- All calculations client-side (no backend)

## Implementation Phases
1. Project setup + types + state management
2. Input forms (4 tabs with Excel defaults pre-loaded)
3. Core calculation engine (cost spreading, revenue, GST)
4. Funding & debt solver (iterative convergence)
5. Dashboard outputs (matching Excel layout exactly)
6. Charts & visualizations (7 charts including funding structure over time)
7. Verification against Excel values & polish

## Calculation Methodology (Current Decisions)

### Line Fee
Charged on the **peak drawn balance** by default (maximum senior balance reached during the facility term) — per financing term sheet convention where the line fee reflects the maximum committed/drawn amount. The peak balance is computed via the iterative solver: each iteration uses the peak balance from the prior pass as the fee basis, converging to the actual peak debt. Formula: `peakDrawnBalance × lineFeePercent × daysInPeriod / daysPerYear`. Applies for every period that `seniorActive` is true (start month to maturity month inclusive).

**Line Fee Basis is now configurable** via `DebtFacility.lineFeeBasis`:
- `'peak-drawn'` (default): converges via solver to the actual peak balance — matches the legacy Excel model and term sheets that reference maximum drawn amount.
- `'committed-limit'`: charge on the full approved facility limit each active period — matches term sheets where the lender charges the fee on the full commitment (reserved capital).
- `'undrawn-commitment'`: charge only on the undrawn portion (`limit − drawn`) — commitment-fee style.

Choose the basis that matches the actual term sheet. Do not change the default unless the lender specifies otherwise.

### ITC Recovery
GST paid on costs (`gstOnCosts`) is modelled as a cash recovery from the ATO (Input Tax Credit). In the funding waterfall, `gstOnCosts[i - itcLag]` is added to revenue each period to net it against the cost outflow, so the waterfall funds costs on an effective ex-GST basis. The `MonthlyCashflow.itcRecovery` field records this recovery and is included in the net cashflow formula to keep the per-period net ≈ $0.

The lag is configurable via `AdminConfig.itcRecoveryLagMonths` (default 0 = same-period recovery, matches Excel). Set to 1–3 months to model realistic quarterly BAS timing for lender-facing models.

### GST Vendor Withholding (s.72-55)
When `AdminConfig.applyGSTWithholding=true`, purchasers of margin-scheme residential settlements withhold 1/11 of the GST-exclusive price and remit directly to the ATO under GSTA s.72-55. The developer's cash inflow at settlement is reduced accordingly. Disabled by default — enable for lender-facing models where settlement cash should be shown net of withholding.

### GST Supply Type Classification
`RevenueLineItem.supplyType` controls GST treatment:
- `'margin-scheme'` (default when `gstIncluded=true`): Division 75 GSTA, GST on taxable margin only
- `'standard'`: Standard-rated supply (GST on full price × 1/11)
- `'input-taxed'` (default when `gstIncluded=false`): No GST output, no ITC attributable
- `'going-concern'`: GSTA s.38-325 exempt (GST-free, vendor+purchaser must both be registered)

`RentalIncomeItem.supplyType` defaults to `'input-taxed'` (long-term residential, s.40-70). Set to `'standard'` for short-term letting / hotel accommodation which is standard-rated.

### Contingency GST
`AdminConfig.contingencyGSTMode` controls whether GST is applied to the contingency reserve:
- `'full'` (default): GST applied to reserve (legacy; assumes contingency will be spent on creditable acquisitions)
- `'none'`: No GST on the reserve; GST applied only when contingency is actually spent on invoiced supplies

### Lender GST Exemption
`DebtFacility.lenderIsGSTExempt` (default `true`) assumes the lender is an exempt financial institution (GSTA s.40-60) and fees are GST-free. Set to `false` for non-bank lenders — fees are then uplifted by gstRate to reflect the GST-inclusive cash cost (no ITC recoverable on financial supply acquisitions under s.11-15(2)(a)).

### PM Fee Base
PM fee = rate × sum of all other costs **including** GST on costs **and** preliminary finance costs (two-pass: preliminary solve estimates finance costs, which then feed into a second PM fee computation). This matches Excel's GST+finance-inclusive base.

### IRR Timing Convention
IRR is calculated on monthly equity cashflows using Newton-Raphson, then annualised via `(1 + r_monthly)^12 − 1`. Each cashflow at period `t` is discounted by `(1 + r)^t` (month-start convention — cashflows are placed at the beginning of each period). For hurdle comparisons, note that investors may expect end-of-period discounting which would add ~1 pp at typical rates.

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
Calculated per-period as: Operating Cashflow (revenue − operating costs) / Debt Service (interest + fees + principal repayment). Reported as average, minimum, and peak values in `DashboardData.dscr`. Target threshold configurable via `AdminConfig.dscrTarget` (default 1.25×).

### Peak Equity Exposure
Tracked as the maximum cumulative equity injected net of repatriations; reported in `DashboardData.dscr.peakEquity` along with the month of peak.

### Payback Period
First month where cumulative (equity repatriations + profit distributions) ≥ cumulative equity injections. Reported in `DashboardData.otherIndicators.paybackPeriodMonths`.

### GST Compliance Schedule
`DashboardData.gstCompliance` exports the margin-scheme apportionment, GST outputs by supply type, ITC claimable, and net GST payable. Supports ATO audit defence for taxpayers applying Division 75 (GSTR 2006/1).

### Senior Interest
Charged on the **opening drawn balance** each period using a daily-rate formula: `openBalance × allInRate × daysInPeriod / daysPerYear`. The all-in rate = margin + BBSY (line fee is a separate fee, not included in interest rate).

### Reconciliation Status (vs KK Feaso Model Draft v43 defaults)
| Metric | App | Excel | Gap | Status |
|--------|-----|-------|-----|--------|
| Total Profit | $169.9M | $170.1M | -0.15% | ✅ |
| Senior Interest | $29.3M | $29.9M | -1.8% | ✅ |
| Senior Fees | $34.6M | $29.5M | +17.4% | ❌ lineFeeBasis (see note) |
| PM Fees | $21.1M | $23.2M | -9.2% | ✅ (within tolerance) |
| IRR (waterfall) | 22.68% | 23.02% | -0.3pp | ✅ |
| CoC | 2.303× | 2.303× | 0% | ✅ |
| Equity In/Out | $130.4M | $130.4M | 0% | ✅ |
| Net Cashflow | ≈$0 | ≈$0 | — | ✅ |

**Line Fee note**: default is `peak-drawn` (matches legacy baseline). For lenders that charge on the committed facility limit, change `DebtFacility.lineFeeBasis` to `'committed-limit'` via the Financing Inputs UI.

**Main profit variance drivers** (app vs Excel, $170.1M target, post-fixes):
1. Senior fees: +$5.1M over (peak-debt line fee — configurable) → profit -$5.1M
2. PM fees: -$2.1M under (two-pass iteration partially closes prior gap) → profit +$2.1M
3. Senior interest: -$0.5M under → profit +$0.5M
4. GST on revenue: ≈$0 delta → profit ≈$0
5. Unexplained residual: +$2.2M (settlement timing / rounding)
6. **Net: -$0.3M explained gap → -0.15% total profit gap ✅**
